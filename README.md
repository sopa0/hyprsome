# Hyprsome
Hyprsome is a binary that interacts with Hyprland's Unix socket to make workspaces behave similarly to AwesomeWM in a multi-monitor setup.

If you're focused on a monitor and press SUPER+[1-9], you'll only switch to the workspaces that are bound to that monitor.

It is inspired by Swaysome, which does a similar thing for Sway.

# Installation
`
cargo install hyprsome
`

# Usage
Once the binary is installed, you can modify your ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf to accomodate it.
Here is an example of a dual monitor setup:

```
monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1.33
monitor=DP-1,transform,1
workspace=DP-1,1
monitor=HDMI-A-1,3440x1440@100,813x0,1
workspace=HDMI-A-1,11
```

Most noteworthy thing here is the 'workspace' keyword that I use to bind a default workspace for each monitor.


Then you can bind workspaces to your different monitors.

It is very important that you bind your workspaces in order.

Check the results of `hyprctl monitors`. Bind workspaces from 1 to 9 on your monitor that has 0 as an id.

Then just bind workspaces by prefixing numbers by the id of the monitor they're bound to.

Here, HDMI-A-1's id is 1, so I bind workspaces from 11 to 19 to it.

```
  workspace=1,monitor:DP-1
  workspace=2,monitor:DP-1
  workspace=3,monitor:DP-1
  workspace=4,monitor:DP-1
  workspace=5,monitor:DP-1

  workspace=11,monitor:HDMI-A-1
  workspace=12,monitor:HDMI-A-1
  workspace=13,monitor:HDMI-A-1
  workspace=14,monitor:HDMI-A-1
  workspace=15,monitor:HDMI-A-1
```

Then it's just a matter of making sure your regular workspace keybinds call hyprsome.

```
bind=SUPER,1,exec,hyprsome workspace 1
bind=SUPER,2,exec,hyprsome workspace 2
bind=SUPER,3,exec,hyprsome workspace 3
bind=SUPER,4,exec,hyprsome workspace 4
bind=SUPER,5,exec,hyprsome workspace 5

bind=SUPERSHIFT,1,exec,hyprsome move 1
bind=SUPERSHIFT,2,exec,hyprsome move 2
bind=SUPERSHIFT,3,exec,hyprsome move 3
bind=SUPERSHIFT,4,exec,hyprsome move 4
bind=SUPERSHIFT,5,exec,hyprsome move 5

```

# Limitations
This is alpha software and my first program in Rust, bugs are bound to happen but nothing that will break your system.

Some features are most likely missing.
